<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isocyanate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based Blocked Isocyanate</li><li>Solvent-based Blocked Isocyanate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The isocyanate market is divided into two main types: water-based blocked isocyanates and solvent-based blocked isocyanates. Water-based blocked isocyanates are formulations that use water as a carrier instead of solvents. They are environmentally friendly and have low volatile organic compound emissions. On the other hand, solvent-based blocked isocyanates use organic solvents as carriers. They offer excellent performance but may have higher VOC emissions. Both types cater to different application needs and industry requirements.</p></p>
