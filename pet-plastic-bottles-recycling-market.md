<p><ul><li>Chemical Recycling</li><li>Mechanical Recycling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PET plastic bottles can be recycled through two main market types, chemical recycling and mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling involves breaking down the plastic bottles into their basic chemical components, which are then used to make new plastic products. This process offers the advantage of being able to transform even degraded plastic into high-quality products. On the other hand, mechanical recycling involves grinding the bottles into flakes, which are then melted and used to produce new bottles or other products. This method is more commonly used but may result in a lower quality of recycled plastic.</p></p>
