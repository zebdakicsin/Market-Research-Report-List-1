<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Scooter Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubeless Tires</li><li>Tubed Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric scooter tires market offers two types of tires: tubeless tires and tubed tires. Tubeless tires are made without an inner tube, allowing them to be puncture-resistant and lightweight. They are easy to maintain and provide a smooth ride. In contrast, tubed tires consist of an inner tube inside the tire, which can be easily replaced in case of a puncture.
