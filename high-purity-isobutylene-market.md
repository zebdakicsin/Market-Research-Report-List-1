<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Purity Isobutylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MTBE Decomposition Method</li><li>C4 Fraction Separation Method</li><li>Isobutane Dehydrogenation Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The High Purity Isobutylene market can be categorized into three types based on the different production methods. The first method is MTBE (Methyl tert-butyl ether) Decomposition, where isobutylene is obtained by separating it from the by-products of MTBE production. The second method is C4 Fraction Separation, which involves separating isobutylene from a mixture of C4 hydrocarbons. Lastly, the Isobutane Dehydrogenation method involves the conversion of isobutane to isobutylene. These methods differ in their processes for obtaining high purity isobutylene for various industrial applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The High Purity Isobutylene Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Butyl Rubber</li><li>Polyisobutylene</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>High purity isobutylene is primarily used in the production of butyl rubber and polyisobutylene. Butyl rubber is widely used in industries such as automotive, construction, and healthcare for its excellent impermeability to gases, which makes it ideal for applications such as tire inner liners and inner tubes. Polyisobutylene, on the other hand, is utilized as a viscosity modifier in lubricant and fuel additives, as well as a thickening agent in adhesives, coatings, and sealants. Both applications rely on high purity isobutylene to ensure optimal product performance.</p></p>
