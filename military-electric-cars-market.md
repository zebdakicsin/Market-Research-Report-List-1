<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Electric Cars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Electric Vehicles</li><li>Hybrid Electric Vehicles</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The military electric cars market comprises two major types: pure electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Pure EVs are solely powered by electricity and do not have an internal combustion engine. They offer zero-emission transportation and are typically used for short-range missions. On the other hand, HEVs possess both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine. They can be powered by electricity or gasoline and provide greater range, making them suitable for longer military operations. Both types of electric cars contribute to reducing dependency on fossil fuels and decreasing environmental impact.</p></p>
