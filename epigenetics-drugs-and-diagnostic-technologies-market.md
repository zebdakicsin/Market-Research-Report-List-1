<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epigenetics Drugs and Diagnostic Technologies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HDAC inhibitors</li><li>DNMT inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Epigenetics Drugs and Diagnostic Technologies market includes HDAC inhibitors and DNMT inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors are drugs that target enzymes called histone deacetylases, which regulate gene expression by modifying proteins associated with DNA. These inhibitors are used to treat specific types of cancer and have potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases. DNMT inhibitors, on the other hand, target enzymes called DNA methyltransferases, which add methyl groups to DNA and can affect gene expression. These inhibitors are being studied for their potential role in cancer treatment and other epigenetic disorders.</p></p>
