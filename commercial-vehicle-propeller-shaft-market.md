<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Propeller Shaft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Shaft</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle propeller shaft market consists of two main types: rigid shaft and hollow shaft. A rigid shaft is a solid and sturdy component that provides a direct connection between the transmission and the differential of a vehicle. It is commonly used in heavy-duty commercial vehicles to transmit torque and overcome high loads. On the other hand, a hollow shaft is a propeller shaft with a hollow center, offering lighter weight and better fuel efficiency. Hollow shafts are often used in light to medium-duty commercial vehicles to reduce vehicle weight and improve overall performance.</p></p>
