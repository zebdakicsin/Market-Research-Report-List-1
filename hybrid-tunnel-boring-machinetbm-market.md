<p><strong>The Hybrid Tunnel Boring Machine(TBM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft ground TBMs</li><li>Hard Rock TBMs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A Hybrid Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a type of excavating equipment used in tunnel construction. Its design combines elements from both soft ground TBMs and hard rock TBMs. Soft ground TBMs are used in soil conditions with low strength, such as clay or sand, and often employ earth pressure balance systems. Hard rock TBMs, on the other hand, are used in more demanding conditions with high strength rocks and typically use drilling and blasting methods. A hybrid TBM is versatile and can adapt to different ground conditions, optimizing efficiency and productivity in tunnel construction projects.</p></p>
