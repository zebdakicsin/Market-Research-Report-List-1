<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passivation Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitric Acid</li><li>Citric Acid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passivation chemicals are used to remove iron or iron compounds from surfaces to prevent corrosion. Nitric acid is a type of passivation chemical that works by dissolving iron to create a layer of metal oxide, which protects the underlying metal from corrosion. Citric acid, on the other hand, is a milder alternative to nitric acid, and it acts as a chelating agent, binding to iron ions and removing them from the surface. Both types of passivation chemicals are extensively used in various industries to enhance the durability and resistance of metal surfaces against corrosion.</p></p>
