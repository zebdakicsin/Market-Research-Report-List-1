<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rear Wheel Steering Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Steering</li><li>Active Steering</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rear wheel steering refers to a mechanism allowing the wheels at the back of a vehicle to turn in response to steering input. There are two types of rear wheel steering in the market: passive steering and active steering. Passive steering uses a mechanical linkage to turn the rear wheels, triggered by the vehicle's motion. This technology improves stability and maneuverability. On the other hand, active steering employs electronic control systems to independently steer the rear wheels, enhancing agility, cornering performance, and overall handling of the vehicle.</p></p>
