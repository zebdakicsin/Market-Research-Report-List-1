<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The White Carbon Blacks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumed White Carbon Black</li><li>Precipitation White Carbon Black</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>White carbon blacks are types of carbon blacks that are produced using different manufacturing processes. Fumed white carbon black is manufactured by burning hydrocarbons in a flame and then collecting the soot formed. It has a high surface area and is widely used in various applications, such as coatings, rubber, and plastics. On the other hand, precipitation white carbon black is produced by mixing chemicals and allowing the resulting reaction product to settle. It has a lower surface area compared to fumed white carbon black and is used in applications like paints, adhesives, and sealants.</p></p>
