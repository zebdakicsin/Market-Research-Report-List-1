<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Articulated Bus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-decker Bus</li><li>Double-decker Bus</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The articulated bus market consists of two main types: single-decker and double-decker buses. Single-decker buses are designed with a single level and provide seating for passengers only. They are commonly used in urban areas and have a larger seating capacity than regular buses. On the other hand, double-decker buses have two levels, with seating available on both levels and additional standing space on the lower level. These buses are typically used in areas with high demand for public transportation, allowing more passengers to be transported efficiently.</p></p>
