<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Wire</li><li>Hot Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensors market comprises two main types: Hot Wire and Hot Film. Hot Wire sensors have a fine wire heated to a constant temperature, which is cooled down by the intake air. The change in temperature correlates to the amount of air entering the engine. Hot Film sensors, on the other hand, use a film element heated by electrical current, with the cooling effect of the incoming air causing changes in resistance. Both types provide vital data to the engine control unit to ensure accurate air-fuel ratio for optimal engine performance.</p></p>
