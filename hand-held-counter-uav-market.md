<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand-held Counter UAV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Recognition</li><li>Active Recognition</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hand-held Counter UAV market includes two types: Passive Recognition and Active Recognition. Passive Recognition systems detect and track unidentified UAVs without actively engaging or disrupting them. This type can be stealthy to avoid detection by the adversary. On the other hand, Active Recognition systems actively engage and disrupt UAVs by using radio frequency (RF) technology to collect data and analyze the UAV's signals. This type may have the advantage of neutralizing threats but may also reveal the user's location. Each type has its pros and cons, and their selection depends on the specific operational requirements.</p></p>
