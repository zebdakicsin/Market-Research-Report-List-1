<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Alloy Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast</li><li>Forged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnesium alloy wheels are categorized into two types: cast and forged. Cast magnesium alloy wheels are made by pouring molten magnesium alloy into a mold and allowing it to cool and solidify, resulting in a wheel with a smoother surface finish. On the other hand, forged magnesium alloy wheels are created by heating the magnesium alloy and then shaping it under extreme pressure, resulting in a stronger and more durable wheel. Both types offer distinct benefits, and widely serve the automotive industry for their lightweight and high-performance characteristics.</p></p>
