<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Tank Heating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heating</li><li>Indirect Heating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric tank heating market consists of two main types - direct heating and indirect heating. In direct heating, the heating element is in direct contact with the liquid inside the tank, resulting in efficient heat transfer. This method is commonly used for smaller tanks and quick heating requirements. On the other hand, indirect heating involves transferring heat to the tank through a heat exchanger. This method is suitable for larger tanks and can be used for heating liquids that are sensitive to direct contact with heating elements.</p></p>
