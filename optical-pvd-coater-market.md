<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical PVD Coater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporation Equipment</li><li>Sputtering Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The optical PVD coater market consists of two main types of equipment: evaporation equipment and sputtering equipment. Evaporation equipment is used for thin film deposition by heating the coating material until it vaporizes and then condenses onto the substrate. Sputtering equipment, on the other hand, uses ion bombardment to dislodge atoms from a target material, which then condenses onto the substrate. Both types of equipment are essential in the optical PVD coater market for producing high-quality thin films with various applications in industries like electronics, optics, and automotive.</p></p>
