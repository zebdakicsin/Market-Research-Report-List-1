<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Passenger Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PHEV</li><li>BEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric passenger car market can be divided into two main types: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and a battery, allowing them to run on both gasoline and electricity. This type provides the flexibility of long-range travel, as the engine can be used when the battery is depleted. On the other hand, BEVs solely rely on electricity stored in their batteries for propulsion, offering zero-emission driving. BEVs generally have a limited range compared to PHEVs but are considered more environmentally friendly.</p></p>
