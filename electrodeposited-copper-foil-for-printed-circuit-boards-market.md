<p><strong>The Electrodeposited Copper Foil for Printed Circuit Boards Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Sided Board</li><li>Double Sided Board</li><li>Multi Layered Board</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electrodeposited copper foil is extensively used in the production of printed circuit boards (PCBs). In single-sided boards, a layer of copper foil is applied to only one side of the substrate, allowing for the creation of simple circuits. Double-sided boards have copper foils on both sides, enabling the design of more complex circuits by connecting components on either side. Multi-layered boards involve the stacking of multiple PCB layers with copper foils in between, facilitating the construction of highly intricate circuits for advanced electronic devices.</p></p>
