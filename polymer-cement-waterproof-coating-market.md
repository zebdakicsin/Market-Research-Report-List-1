<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Cement Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I (High Elongation, High Poly-ash Ratio)</li><li>Type II (Low Elongation, Low Poly-ash Ratio)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Polymer Cement Waterproof Coating market is categorized into two types: Type I and Type II. Type I coatings have a high elongation and a high poly-ash ratio, meaning they are capable of stretching and are made with a larger amount of polymer and ash content. On the other hand, Type II coatings have a low elongation and a low poly-ash ratio, indicating that they have limited stretching capabilities and are composed of a smaller proportion of polymer and ash materials.</p></p>
